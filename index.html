    <h1>My Personal Portfolio</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h2 id="header">I have been in the wonderful world of coding and app development since around 1 year. I just love coding. From that time till today, I've liked coding so much that I think of it as fun, not as a part of my studies. My first coding language was blockly. I started off with Code.org. I've made some or the other app from all the coding labs available in Code.org. I started with my basics over there. In Code.org, I learned various new concepts such as Variables, Events, Loops and many others. I made basic apps in code.org.I really liked, and still like, the website a lot. After that, I used Thunkable. Thunkable is a way more advanced and professional coding platform than Code.org. It had a lot of things which Code.org didn't, such as acess to databases, many more designing options and a lot of other things. In here, I made very advanced and complicated apps, such as online chatting ones, online games, and many other. Thunkable may be a lot more complicated than Code.org, but, we can do a lot more in it compared to Code.org. After Blockly,I started with making websites. I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript. My website making software was Codepen.io. After that, we shifted off to Brackets. Brackets is way easier than codepen. The coding software I'm currently using, is Brackets. This website is also made using Brackets, and hosted non github.io. I have also learned how to make chatbots on Dialogflow, and to create databases on firebase. Everything I've attatched below, is made of either Code.org or Dialogflow. I would love to show you my creations on Thunkable, which are way better, more professional, and more advanced than these ones, but, I don't yet know how to copy the embed link from Thunkable. Below, you'll find Apps, games, my personal chatbot, and a few other creations, all made by me.  </h2>
